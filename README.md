# Human Supervised Sampling

## Introduction

Human Supervised Sampling (HSS) is my solution to LLM hallucination. It works by replacing the automatic sampling step with manual selection by human, which dramatically improves performance.

## Demo

This repository is a demo of HSS. You can try it by running `deno task dev`.
